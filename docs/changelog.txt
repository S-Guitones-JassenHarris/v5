V5 Quotation Tool - Changelog

-v05.2: Steve Guitones 
. begin updating printer data. for bambulab printers, used https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/general/power-consumption as a basis for power



- v05.1: Steve Guitones (15/12/2025)
. Initial working prototype uploaded to github , https://s-guitones-jassenharris.github.io/v5/ 
. uses deprecated printer and material data, this needs to be updated on the regular and is the main purpose of this change log. 
. for code errors and calculation irregularities. kindly refer to the code base itself and not the project file found on chatgpt named 
(steve, system design blueprint). This is mainly due to length of converstation. the chat session no longer remembers code details accurately,
additionally, code has been manually updated and changed to fit the needs. I recommend simply doing copy paste sessions with chatgpt using new chats, 
or if you can manually just code even more better.
