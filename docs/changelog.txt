-v05.2: Steve Guitones (16/12/2025)
. begin updated printer and material data. Resin densities need to be defined still( all were given an arbitrary density  of 1.1). Fixed lead time
calculations and input labels. b
. a bug regarding import and export has been found, wherein different results come from the same imported inputs. this has not yet been replicated,
highly recommend double checking results summary in between exports when doing an import export loop


- v05.1: Steve Guitones (15/12/2025)
. Initial working prototype uploaded to github , https://s-guitones-jassenharris.github.io/v5/ 
. uses deprecated printer and material data, this needs to be updated on the regular and is the main purpose of this change log. 
. for code errors and calculation irregularities. kindly refer to the code base itself and not the project file found on chatgpt named 
(steve, system design blueprint). This is mainly due to length of converstation. the chat session no longer remembers code details accurately,
additionally, code has been manually updated and changed to fit the needs. I recommend simply doing copy paste sessions with chatgpt using new chats, 
or if you can manually just code even more better.
