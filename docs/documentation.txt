V5 Quotation Tool – Documentation


Introduction

The V5 Quotation Tool is a browser-based multi-quote calculator designed to simplify pricing for 3D printing and related services.
It supports multiple quote tabs, dynamic inputs, cost breakdowns, global totals, and data export/import using encoded JSON.

This documentation covers:
-How to use the calculator
-Basic reference to the calculations that the calculator uses

HOW TO USE THE CALCULATOR

Step 1 — Choose a service type, use the Service type dropdown.  Selecting a service type loads its specific input fields.
Step 2 — Fill in the required input fields
Step 3 — Click “Update summary”

BASIC CALCULATION REFERENCE

====================================================
SERVICE — 3D DESIGN
====================================================

INPUT VARIABLES
---------------
- Estimated design hours (hours)
- Design complexity (Easy, Novice, Standard, Hard, Expert)
- Profit margin (%)
- Rush option (Yes/No)
- Electrical cost per kWh (optional, default PHP 12.5)
- Service cost per hour (optional, default PHP 500)

CALCULATED VARIABLES & FORMULAS
-------------------------------

1) Complexity factor
   Each complexity level increases the workload.
   Easy = lowest, Expert = highest.

   Complexity factor = (1 + complexity level) ÷ 2

2) Effective design hours
   Effective hours = Estimated design hours × Complexity factor

3) Design time (days)
   Normal delivery:
     Design days = Effective design hours ÷ 8 hours/day
   Rush delivery:
     Design days = Effective design hours ÷ 10 hours/day

   Minimum delivery time is 3 days if any work exists.

4) Power cost
   Power cost = Laptop watts × Effective hours × Electricity rate ÷ 1000

5) Service cost
   Service cost = effective hours × Service cost per hour

6) Total expense
   Total expense = Power cost + Service cost

7) Final selling price
   Final price = Total expense ÷ (1 − Profit margin)

8) Rush price
   Rush price = Final price × 1.5


====================================================
SERVICE — FDM/FGF MULTI-COLOR/ SINGLE COLOR 3D PRINTING
====================================================

INPUT VARIABLES
---------------
- Print hours
- Print minutes
- Machine selection
- Materials : Up to 8 materials, each with weight (grams)
- Number of batches
- Number of test prints
- Handling time per batch (minutes)
- Preparation time (minutes)
- Profit margin (%)
- Rush option (Yes/No)
- Electrical cost per kWh
- Service cost per hour
- Miscellaneous costs (optional)

CALCULATED VARIABLES & FORMULAS
-------------------------------

1) Total print time (hours)
   Total hours = Print hours + (Print minutes ÷ 60)

2) Material cost
   Each material:
     Material cost = (Weight in grams ÷ 1000) × Price per kg

   Total material cost = Sum of all material costs

3) Machine cost
   Machine cost = (Machine price ÷ Machine lifespan hours) × Print hours

4) Power cost
   Power cost = Machine wattage × Print hours × Electricity rate ÷ 1000

5) Single print expense
   Single print expense = Machine cost + Power cost + Material cost

6) Service cost
   Total service minutes =  [Handling time × (Batches + Test prints)] + Preparation time

   Service cost = Total service minutes × (Service cost per hour ÷ 60)

7) Printing expenses
   Test prints expense = Single print expense × Test prints
   Sell prints expense = Single print expense × Batches

8) Selling prices
   Sell prints price = Sell prints expense ÷ (1 − Profit margin)
   Test prints price = Test prints expense + half of the normal profit

9) Final selling price
   Final price = Sell prints price + Test prints price + Service cost + Misc costs

10) Rush price
    Rush price = Final price × 1.5

====================================================
SERVICE — RESIN 3D PRINTING
====================================================

INPUT VARIABLES
---------------
- Print hours & minutes
- Print volume (mL)
- Resin density
- Machine selection
- Material selection
- Profit margin (%)
- Batches & test prints
- Rush option

CALCULATED VARIABLES & FORMULAS
-------------------------------

1) Weight conversion
   Weight (kg) = Print volume × Density ÷ 1000

2) Material cost
   Material cost = Weight × Price per kg

3) All other calculations same as FDM Single-Color Printing:
   - Machine cost
   - Power cost
   - Service cost
   - Profit calculation


====================================================
SERVICE — 3D SCANNING
====================================================

INPUT VARIABLES
---------------
- Estimated scan hours
- Scan complexity
- Machine selection
- Laptop usage (Yes/No)
- Profit margin (%)
- Rush option

CALCULATED VARIABLES & FORMULAS
-------------------------------

1) Complexity-adjusted scan hours
   Adjusted hours = Estimated hours × Complexity factor

2) Scan days
   Scan days = Adjusted hours ÷ 8 (minimum 3 days)

3) Machine cost
   Machine cost = (Machine price ÷ Machine lifespan hours) × Adjusted hours

4) Power costs
   Laptop power cost = Laptop watts × Adjusted hours × Electricity rate ÷ 1000
   Machine power cost = Machine watts × Adjusted hours × Electricity rate ÷ 1000
   Power Cost = Laptop power cost + Machine power cost

5) Service cost
   Service cost = Adjusted hours × Service cost per hour

6) Final price
   Final price = Total expense ÷ (1 − Profit margin)


====================================================
SERVICE — WASH & CURE
====================================================

INPUT VARIABLES
---------------
- Handling time per batch (minutes)
- Wash time per batch (minutes)
- Cure time per batch (minutes)
- Wash & cure batch counts
- Machine selections
- Profit margin (%)
- Rush option

CALCULATED VARIABLES & FORMULAS
-------------------------------

1) Total service time
   Service time =
     Handling time × Maximum batch count

2) Total machine time
   Machine time = (Wash time × Wash batches) + (Cure time × Cure batches)

3) Machine cost
   Machine cost = Machine minutes × (Machine price ÷ Lifespan minutes)

4) Power cost
   Power cost = Machine minutes × Wattage × Electricity rate ÷ (60 × 1000)

5) Service cost
   Service cost =  Service minutes × Service cost per hour ÷ 60

6) Total expense
   Total expense = Service cost + Machine costs + Power costs

7) Final price
   Final price = Total expense ÷ (1 − Profit margin)
